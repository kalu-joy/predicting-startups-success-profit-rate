# predicting-startups-success-profit-rate
This project is a linear regression model conducted on a dataset which contains the details of 50 startups. We try to use this dataset to predict the profit of a new Startup based on certain features. To Venture Capitalists this could be a sign as to whether they should invest in a particular Startup or not.
